# Importance of Dyslexia detection

According to the experts, they agree that early detection, diagnosis or intervention is key to giving a dyslexic person the opportunity, support and tools to keep up with or even surpass their non-dyslexic peers. It also helps to avoid self-esteem issues that dyslexics can typically feel.

# About Nazka's Adventure
Nazka's Adventure is our solution for Dyslexia Detection. Our solution for early detection is a painless, free and fun gamified screening tool. We’ve designed this game to be super approachable. Players can play a series mini games each design to test cognitive functions known to be deficit and not deficit in dyslexia. A player's play through is compared with a norm and depending on if the player is above or below the norm, the screening tool will recommend to the parent(s) whether their child should see a professional/speech therapist or not.

# What is Dyslexia?

Dyslexia is a learning difficulty which primarily affects reading and writing skills. Dyslexic people may have difficulty processing and remembering information they see and hear, which can affect learning and the acquisition of literacy skills. Dyslexia can also impact on other areas such as organisational skills. Unlike a learning disability, intelligence isn't affected. It's estimated that 10% to 15% of  people are dyslexia. Dyslexia is a lifelong problem that can present challenges on a daily basis, but support is available to improve reading and writing skills and help those with the problem to be successful at school and work.
